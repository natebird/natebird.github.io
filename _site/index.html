      <div class="e-content"><p>The process we follow for releasing software starts with a design planning meeting. It has a form to plan the release and a full grant chart is supposed to be attached to the document. All of this happens before any code is written. The end date is chosen before we get a chance to dig into the details. The schedule always needs to be adjusted. The plain never stays the same. And it always is late. The dates are chosen so far in advance with an optimistic mindset that it is nearly impossible to keep them.</p>

<p>Planning is useful when you need to coordinate with other groups. But only a couple weeks in advance. I don’t know how many times a deploy has been scheduled a month or so in advance and that date is never hit. But we can plan what needs to be done and then work on the highest priority items until we finish.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I like to plan what needs to be done but things go awry when you schedule them.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2018/03/06/failure-is-not.html">Failure is not a rite of passage</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>“Failure is not a prerequisite for success.”</p>

<p>In the corporate world failure isn’t celebrated like in startup culture. In fact I would say the pendulum has swung the other way and everything is protected so much and all risk is analyzed, categorized, and catalogued. Not allowing failure in the process means that a lot of extra work is done before anything is released. It also means that small mistakes can take a long time to fix because of the long time frames required to release something new because the new thing can’t have any known issues.</p>

<p>So while failure in startup culture is celebrated and the motto is move fast and break things. The corporate world is moving so slowly that problems compound and reaction to changes takes months or years.</p>

<p>A healthy balance of fast processes with careful consideration and thought into what is released goes a long way to creating quality products.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>The real world says, “the only things that win are what people already know and do, even if those things are flawed and inefficient.”</p>

<p>In the corporate world the things people know and do are usually processes that are strictly defined or mandated from above without reason. </p>

<p>For instance, the use of MS Word for all documentation or getting signatures from all departments (regardless of whether it effects them) to deploy code. </p>

<p>For my team, I’m moving our documents to a git repo and writing them in markdown to avoid hours of formatting templates and reviewing redlines in Word. </p>

<p>It’s a small change but it will have a big impact on our ability to release quickly. The process managers might balk at this change but it will be much easier to maintain and my team will continue to deliver results with much less resources.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>The Apple TV Remote receives a lot of criticism about its ergonomics and usability. Well, Elgato has a nice cover for the Remote that has solved some of the ergonomics issues, at least for me. I can now always feel which end is top and bottom by feel (the cord). It is grippy so it stays on the couch arm without worry of sliding off. It’s also a bit bigger so it fits better in my hand and doesn’t get lost in the cushions as easily. As a bonus, it’s magnetic. </p>

      <div class="e-content"><h2 id="general-iphone-x-tips">General iPhone X Tips</h2>
<p>1) Fast(er) access to the multi-tasking switcher. Pull up from the bottom less than an inch, hesitate, then lift your finger from the screen. It is “pull up and lift finger” rather than a “flicking upward” gesture. Also, you don’t need to wait for the haptic feedback.</p>

<p>2) You can still Force quit apps in the multitasker. First enter the multi-tasking view, then hold down on any of the apps. A red circle will appear in the top left of each app screen. You can tap the red circle or swipe up on the app screen to force quit each app. I don’t recommend force quitting any apps regularly. This should only be used in situations where you believe a particular app is misbehaving (i.e. Facebook). Force quitting all apps does not improve battery life. In fact, it reduces battery life by requiring more processing to start rather than resuming apps. </p>

<p>3) Animoji doesn’t work in the dark.</p>

<p>4) You can take a screenshot by pushing either volume button and the power button at the same time. Editing or sharing screenshots is awesome in iOS 11. Try it!</p>

<p>5) If you hold down the top volume button and the power button at the same time for 2-3 seconds it will lock the phone and disable all biometric authentication (Face ID and Touch ID). Some call this the Police hold because you can activate it while handing your phone to an officer. Once activated only the passcode can unlock the phone.</p>

<h2 id="face-id-tips">Face ID Tips</h2>
<p>1) Works in bright light or darkness just as well as indoor lighting.</p>

<p>2) Requires being right side up to work; It doesn’t work sideways or upside down.</p>

<p>3) It needs to be 8” - 24” from your face to work consistently.</p>

<p>4) The best way to use Face ID is to pretend that your phone doesn’t have a passcode or Touch ID. Just tap the screen to wake the phone and then swipe up to go to the home screen or the previously used app.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>Around this time of year I start auditing some of my online security. Here are some links and tips so you can do the same. Have a happy and safe 2018.</p>

<p>First, I clean out all the connected applications to Facebook, Twitter, and Google. Usually these are services I don’t use (or don’t exist anymore). They generally have more access to my data than I’m comfortable. Clean it up!</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Facebook - <a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings">www.facebook.com/settings</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Twitter - <a href="https://twitter.com/settings/applications">twitter.com/settings/…</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Google - <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/u/0/permissions">myaccount.google.com/u/0/permi…</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I use <a href="https://1password.com">1Password</a> to manage all of my passwords. They have a handy section for security audit. You can check how old your passwords are but I mainly focus on the <em>Watchtower</em>  and <em>Weak Passwords</em> sections.</p>
