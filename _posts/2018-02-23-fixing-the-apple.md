The Apple TV Remote receives a lot of criticism about its ergonomics and usability. Well, Elgato has a nice cover for the Remote that has solved some of the ergonomics issues, at least for me. I can now always feel which end is top and bottom by feel (the cord). It is grippy so it stays on the couch arm without worry of sliding off. It's also a bit bigger so it fits better in my hand and doesn't get lost in the cushions as easily. As a bonus, itâ€™s magnetic.
