The linked episode is part of a series about building a perfect country. They visit countries all over the world and find something in which that particular country excels. Rwanda has amazing gender equality laws and regulations. Itâ€™s a great podcast outside of my normal tech episodes. [overcast.fm/+Ip9RuwDk...](https://overcast.fm/+Ip9RuwDkg)
