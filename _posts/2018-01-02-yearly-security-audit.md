Around this time of year I start auditing some of my online security. Here are some links and tips so you can do the same. Have a happy and safe 2018.

First, I clean out all the connected applications to Facebook, Twitter, and Google. Usually these are services I don't use (or don't exist anymore). They generally have more access to my data than I'm comfortable. Clean it up!

* Facebook - [www.facebook.com/settings](https://www.facebook.com/settings)

* Twitter - [twitter.com/settings/...](https://twitter.com/settings/applications)

* Google - [myaccount.google.com/u/0/permi...](https://myaccount.google.com/u/0/permissions)

I use [1Password](https://1password.com) to manage all of my passwords. They have a handy section for security audit. You can check how old your passwords are but I mainly focus on the _Watchtower_  and _Weak Passwords_ sections.
