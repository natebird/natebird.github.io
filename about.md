Hi. I'm Nate. I am a Ruby and Swift developer. I work on the [CardioMEMS Heart Failure System](https://www.sjm.com/en/sjm/cardiomems) which helps doctors better treat patients with heart failure. 

You can also find me on Twitter [@natesbird](https://twitter.com/natesbird). Say hello, I don't bite.
